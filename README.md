# #Vetustamorleando

Everyone loves music, right?

I know I do. 

And because I'm a bit of a nerd, I love data. 

And seeing as Spotify have made their API available for public use, is there a better way of combining my love for data and music? Probably not. 

And so #Vetustamorleando was born. 

# What is #Vetustamorleando?

Simply put, it's an experiment with React and Plotly to show the ten most popular songs in Spain by the Spanish band Vetusta Morla.

# How to view #Vetustamorleando

First, `cd` into the `spotify` folder, then run the command `npm start`.  A web page will then open, and the chart will show.
